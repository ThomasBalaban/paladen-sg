/* 
* pointer:coarse has no support in before-edge IE, or firefox. However chrome and safari supports it across all of their recent versions.
* https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-media-interaction
* Only noting this because paying attention to the support of this function is necessary for this component. If it ever falls out (doesn't often happen but still possible) we will need a new solution
*
* The thought process is that yes, it spits out 3 media queries for 1 thing, but it avoids needing to make a media query testing for every potential screen size.
*
*Basics of idea below --
*- It will always check the min width of 1025px
*- Each potential case gets a second property, such as the -ms- call, that is required, therefor if the browser does not recognize it will move on
*- If nothing is supported it will fall back to tablet view, making sure this component is always usable
*- Any other solution I found required writing no less than 2 media queries in the direct css, one setting desktop properties, and one unsetting them if it happened to be a device
*- We can build other media queries on top of this if necessary pretty easily
*
